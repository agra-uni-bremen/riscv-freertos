Add a virtual MAC address on *enp0s31f6* with name *vpeth1*. The address is assigned randomely.

`sudo ip link add link enp0s31f6 vpeth1 type macvlan`
or, with exact MAC:
`sudo ip link add link enp0s31f6 address 00:11:11:11:11:11 vpeth1 type macvlan`
sudo ip link add link enp0s31f6 address 00:11:11:11:11:11 vpeth1 type macvlan mode bridge


Shows the active interfaces (can see if they are *up* or *down*).

ip link


Activate the virtual interface.

sudo ip link set dev vpeth1 up

(this is done by `make device` as well)


to circumvent calling riscv-vp as root:
`setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip riscv-vp`

Wireshark filter:
((udp ) && (eth.addr == 00:11:11:11:11:11) and !dns and !db-lsp) || (bootp.type == 2)

echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward #https://superuser.com/questions/764986/howto-setup-a-veth-virtual-network/765078
