Add a virtual MAC address on *enp0s31f6* with name *vpeth1*. The address is assigned randomely.

`sudo ip link add link enp0s31f6 vpeth1 type macvlan`
or, with exact MAC:
`sudo ip link add link enp0s31f6 address 00:11:11:11:11:11 vpeth1 type macvlan`

Shows the active interfaces (can see if they are *up* or *down*).

ip link


Activate the virtual interface.

sudo ip link set dev vpeth1 up

(this is done by `make device` as well)


to circumvent calling riscv-vp as root:
`setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip riscv-vp`
