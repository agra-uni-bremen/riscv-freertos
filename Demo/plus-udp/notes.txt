Add a virtual MAC address on *enp0s31f6* with name *vpeth1*. The address is assigned randomely.

`sudo ip link add link enp0s31f6 vpeth1 type macvlan`
or, with exact MAC:
`sudo ip link add link enp0s31f6 address 00:11:11:11:11:11 vpeth1 type macvlan`



Shows the active interfaces (can see if they are *up* or *down*).

ip link


Activate the virtual interface.

sudo ip link set dev vpeth1 up


Add (static) entry to the ARP cache. For whatever reason the FreeRTOS-UDP library sends malformed ARP responses to the linux ARP requests. This workaround allows to just add the device running FreeRTOS to the cache to avoid those requests (probably also deactivate DHCP!?).

sudo arp -s 192.168.0.188 72:5c:b4:2c:ac:4a
